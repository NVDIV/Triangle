# Triangle Calculator

This C program calculates various properties of a triangle using the lengths of its sides. It can compute the perimeter, area, heights, medians, and bisectors. This project was developed during my programming course in my first semester at university.

## Features

- Calculate the perimeter of the triangle.
- Compute the area using Heron's formula.
- Determine the heights corresponding to each side.
- Calculate the medians and bisectors from the sides.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Getting Started

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the ropository:
  ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/NVDIV/Triangle.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd Triangle
```
3. Compile the program:
  ```bash
  gcc -o triangle triangle.c
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
./triangle
```

## How to Use

Enter the lengths of the three sides of the triangle when prompted.
The program will calculate and display the perimeter, area, heights, medians, and bisectors.
