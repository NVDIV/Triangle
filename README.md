# Triangle
This repository contains a C program that calculates various properties of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides. Developed as part of my university coursework, the program computes the perimeter, area, heights, medians, and bisectors of a triangle, providing a comprehensive tool for understanding triangle geometry.
